# Chapter 4: Domains and Hosting - Making Your Application Accessible

## Introduction

Once you've built your application with Bolt Cloud's backend infrastructure, the next step is making it accessible to users with a professional domain name and reliable hosting. In this chapter, we'll explore Bolt's domain management features and deployment through Netlify.

## Domain Management in Bolt Cloud

Traditionally, connecting a custom domain to your website involves complex DNS configuration. Bolt v2 simplifies this dramatically.

### Buy Domains Directly in Bolt

**New Feature**: Purchase domains without leaving Bolt.

**Traditional Process**:
1. Go to domain registrar website (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. Search for available domains
3. Purchase domain
4. Navigate to DNS settings
5. Find hosting service's DNS records
6. Copy/paste complex DNS configuration
7. Wait for propagation (can take 24-48 hours)

**Bolt v2 Process**:
1. Click "Add Domain" in Bolt
2. Search for domain name
3. Purchase (if available)
4. Domain automatically connects
5. HTTPS certificate automatically provisioned
6. Live in minutes

**Time Saved**: Hours → Minutes

### Bring Your Own Domain

Already own a domain? Connecting it is just as easy:

**Simplified Process**:
- No manual DNS record configuration
- No navigating third-party dashboards
- Bolt handles the technical details
- Automatic HTTPS setup

**What Bolt Automates**:
- DNS record creation
- SSL/TLS certificate provisioning
- CDN configuration
- Subdomain management

**Key Term**: *DNS (Domain Name System)* - The system that translates domain names (like mysite.com) into IP addresses that computers use.

### Domain Features

**Included with Bolt Cloud**:
- Custom domains for production sites
- Automatic HTTPS/SSL certificates
- Subdomain support (api.mysite.com, blog.mysite.com)
- Global CDN distribution
- DDoS protection

**Key Term**: *DDoS Protection* - Defense against attacks that try to overwhelm your site with traffic.

## Netlify Integration: One-Click Deployment

**Netlify** is a cloud platform that specializes in hosting modern web applications. It's one of the most popular hosting services, trusted by millions of websites.

**Official Site**: [www.netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com) | **Documentation**: [Netlify Docs](https://docs.netlify.com)

### Why Netlify?

Netlify excels at hosting what are called **JAMstack applications** (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup)—exactly the type of applications Bolt.new creates.

**Benefits of Netlify**:
- ✅ Free tier for personal projects
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS (secure connections)
- ✅ Global CDN (content delivery network)
- ✅ Automatic builds and deployments
- ✅ Instant rollbacks if something goes wrong
- ✅ Custom domain support

**Key Terms**:
- **HTTPS**: Secure, encrypted connection (the lock icon in your browser)
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: Network of servers worldwide that deliver your content from the closest location to each user, making your site faster
- **Rollback**: Reverting to a previous version of your application

### How Bolt.new + Netlify Works

#### Step 1: Build Your Application
Create your application in Bolt.new using the AI-powered development features.

#### Step 2: Deploy with One Click
When ready to go live:
1. Click the "Deploy" button in Bolt.new
2. Select "Netlify" as your deployment target
3. Authorize Bolt.new to connect to Netlify (first time only)
4. Confirm deployment

#### Step 3: Get Your Live URL
Within 30-60 seconds:
- Netlify builds your application
- Creates an optimized production version
- Deploys to their global network
- Provides you with a live URL

**Example URL**: `https://your-app-name-123abc.netlify.app`

#### Step 4: Share and Use
Your application is now live and accessible to anyone with the URL!

### The Netlify Build Process

When you deploy, Netlify automatically:

#### **1. Optimization**
- **Minification**: Removes unnecessary characters from code to reduce file size
  - Example: `function addNumbers(a, b) { return a + b; }` becomes `function addNumbers(a,b){return a+b;}`
- **Bundling**: Combines multiple files into fewer files for faster loading
- **Tree Shaking**: Removes unused code
- **Image Optimization**: Compresses images without visible quality loss

**Key Term**: *Minification* - The process of removing all unnecessary characters from code (spaces, line breaks, comments) to reduce file size without changing functionality.

#### **2. Asset Management**
- Generates appropriate file names with version hashes
- Configures caching for optimal performance
- Serves images in modern formats (WebP, AVIF)

**Key Term**: *Caching* - Storing copies of files so they don't need to be downloaded again on subsequent visits, making your site load much faster.

#### **3. Security**
- Automatically provisions SSL/TLS certificates (enables HTTPS)
- Configures security headers
- Protects against common vulnerabilities

**Key Term**: *SSL/TLS Certificate* - A digital certificate that enables encrypted, secure connections between users and your website.

#### **4. Global Distribution**
- Distributes your application across their global CDN
- Ensures fast loading times worldwide
- Handles traffic spikes automatically

### Continuous Deployment

One of Netlify's most powerful features is **continuous deployment**:

**How It Works**:
1. You make changes in Bolt.new
2. Push changes to GitHub (optional, but recommended)
3. Netlify automatically detects changes
4. Rebuilds and redeploys your application
5. New version goes live automatically

**No manual intervention required**—changes flow from development to production automatically.

### Custom Domains with Netlify

While Netlify provides a free subdomain (like `your-app.netlify.app`), you can connect your own custom domain:

**Process**:
1. Purchase a domain (from GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.) or use Bolt's domain purchase feature
2. Add domain in Netlify settings
3. Update DNS records (Netlify provides instructions)
4. Netlify automatically provisions HTTPS certificate

**Example**: Change from `my-app-abc123.netlify.app` to `www.myawesomeapp.com`

### Netlify Features for Applications

#### **Form Handling**
Netlify can handle form submissions without backend code:

```html
<form netlify>
  <input type="email" name="email" />
  <textarea name="message"></textarea>
  <button>Submit</button>
</form>
```

Adding `netlify` attribute automatically:
- Captures submissions
- Stores them in your Netlify dashboard
- Can trigger email notifications
- Integrates with services like Slack, Zapier

#### **Serverless Functions**
Add backend functionality without managing servers:

**Use Cases**:
- Process payments
- Send emails
- Connect to databases
- Call external APIs with hidden keys

**Example**: A contact form that emails you when submitted

#### **Environment Variables**
Securely store sensitive information:
- API keys
- Database credentials
- Secret tokens

These are kept secure and separate from your code.

**Key Term**: *Environment Variable* - A configuration value stored outside your code that can change between environments (development, production) without code changes.

### Deployment Best Practices with Netlify

#### **1. Preview Deployments**
Before going to production:
- Create a preview deployment
- Test thoroughly
- Share preview URL with team/clients
- Only promote to production when ready

#### **2. Branch Deployments**
Test different versions:
- Create a new branch in Git
- Make experimental changes
- Netlify creates separate deployment
- Merge to main when satisfied

**Key Term**: *Branch* - A separate version of your code where you can make changes without affecting the main version.

#### **3. Rollback Capability**
If something goes wrong:
- Netlify keeps all previous deployments
- One-click rollback to any previous version
- Instant restoration to working state

#### **4. Monitor Analytics**
Netlify provides built-in analytics:
- Page views and visitors
- Popular pages
- Traffic sources
- Load times and performance
