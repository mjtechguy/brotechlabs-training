# Bolt.new: AI-Powered Web Development Platform

## What is Bolt.new?

**Bolt.new** is a revolutionary web development tool created by StackBlitz that allows you to build complete websites and web applications simply by chatting with artificial intelligence (AI). Instead of writing thousands of lines of code yourself, you describe what you want in plain English, and the AI builds it for you—all directly in your web browser.

**Key Term**: *AI (Artificial Intelligence)* - Computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions.

## Why is Bolt.new Important?

As of October 2025, Bolt.new has achieved remarkable success that demonstrates the transformative power of AI-assisted development:

### Success Metrics
- **Over 1 million AI-generated websites** built and deployed in just five months
- **Zero to $4M ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)** in just 4 weeks after launch
- **Usage doubling daily** during initial release period
- **99% reduction in development costs** reported by users for certain tasks
- **Tens of thousands of new customers** in the first weeks
- **3+ million developers** using the StackBlitz ecosystem monthly

**What This Means**: Bolt v2 represents one of the fastest-growing developer tools ever, showing that AI is transforming web development from a specialized skill requiring years of training into something accessible to anyone with an idea. The dramatic cost and time savings (from days/weeks to hours/minutes) prove that professional-grade development is no longer limited to those with extensive coding backgrounds.

## Who Can Use Bolt.new?

- **Beginners**: People with no coding experience who want to bring their ideas to life
- **Entrepreneurs**: Business owners who need to quickly test new ideas without hiring developers
- **Students**: Learners exploring web development and technology
- **Professional Developers**: Experienced programmers who want to speed up their work
- **Designers**: Creative professionals who want to turn their designs into working websites

## What's New in Bolt v2 (Latest Release)

Bolt v2 marks a major evolution, transforming from a prototyping tool into a professional development platform. The tagline "Vibe Coding Goes Pro" captures this shift.

**Major v2 Features**:
- **Professional AI Agents**: Direct access to world-class AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex) with agents-of-agents architecture
- **Bolt Cloud Infrastructure**: Enterprise-grade backend infrastructure built-in (databases, authentication, payments, hosting)
- **Automatic Database Creation**: Unlimited databases created automatically—no manual setup or configuration
- **Integrated Authentication**: User signups, logins, password resets, and role-based access handled automatically
- **Built-in Stripe Integration**: Accept payments and manage subscriptions directly within your applications
- **SEO Pre-Rendering**: Pages are lightning-fast, fully crawlable, and production-ready from day one
- **Domain Management**: Buy domains directly in Bolt or bring your own—no DNS configuration needed
- **GitHub Integration**: Sync projects, collaborate with teams, and fork existing projects
- **No Terminal Required**: Everything works through the visual interface with zero configuration
- **No Error Loops**: Improved reliability eliminates the endless debugging cycles of earlier tools

## The Four Core Capabilities

### 1. **AI-Powered Code Generation with Professional Agents**
Talk to world-class AI coding agents in plain English, and they write professional code for you. Bolt v2 includes access to **Claude Code** and **Codex**, the most advanced AI development assistants available. These agents understand modern web development frameworks and can create everything from simple landing pages to complex, production-ready web applications.

**Key Term**: *AI Agent* - An advanced AI system that can autonomously perform complex tasks, make decisions, and use tools to accomplish goals.

### 2. **Browser-Based Development Environment**
Everything happens in your web browser—no software installation required. You can write, test, and see your website working in real-time, all in one place. This is powered by **WebContainers**, a breakthrough technology that runs the same software developers use on their computers, but entirely in your browser.

### 3. **Bolt Cloud: Integrated Backend Infrastructure**
Unlike other AI coding tools that only generate frontend code, Bolt v2 includes **Bolt Cloud**—a complete backend infrastructure that handles databases, user authentication, file storage, and payments automatically. This means you can build and scale production applications without ever leaving Bolt or managing servers.

**What Bolt Cloud Provides**:
- **Managed Databases**: Unlimited, fully managed, high-performance databases created automatically
- **User Authentication**: Complete auth system with signups, logins, password management, and role-based access
- **Payment Processing**: Direct Stripe integration for accepting payments and managing subscriptions
- **SEO & Performance**: Automatic pre-rendering for fast, search-engine-friendly pages
- **Domain Management**: Buy or connect custom domains without dealing with DNS
- **Enterprise Scale**: Built on Netlify and Supabase, capable of handling millions of users
- **Collaboration**: GitHub sync, project forking, and team workspaces

### 4. **One-Click Deployment**
When you're happy with your creation, you can publish it to the internet with a single click. Bolt.new integrates with hosting services like **Netlify** (a company that makes websites available on the internet) so your site goes live instantly with its own web address.

## How Much Does It Cost?

Bolt.new uses a **token-based pricing system**:

- **What are tokens?** Think of tokens as "fuel" for the AI. Each time the AI generates code or makes changes, it uses tokens. Simple requests use fewer tokens; complex applications use more.

### Pricing Tiers (October 2025)

**Free Tier** (Unlimited Public Projects):
- **Daily Allocation**: ~300,000 tokens per day (resets daily)
- **Features**: Unlimited public projects, bolt.host subdomain hosting
- **Limitations**: Only public projects, daily token cap, Bolt branding
- **Best for**: Learning, open-source projects, experimentation

**Pro Plans** (No daily cap - monthly allocation):

| Plan | Price/Month | Token Allocation | Best For |
|------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| **Pro** | $20 | 10 million tokens | Individual developers, hobbyists |
| **Pro 50** | $50 | 26 million tokens | Frequent builders, side projects |
| **Pro 100** | $100 | 55-60 million tokens | Daily usage, professional work |
| **Pro 200** | $200 | 120 million tokens | Power users, small teams |

**All Pro Plans Include**:
- ✅ Unlimited private projects
- ✅ Custom domain support
- ✅ Token rollover (unused tokens carry forward 1 month)
- ✅ Access to Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4 models
- ✅ Priority support (higher tiers)
- ✅ No daily cap (use all your tokens anytime in the month)

**Key Term**: *Token Rollover* - If you don't use all your monthly tokens, they remain available for one extra month (up to 2 months total).

**Enterprise Plans**: Custom pricing with billions of tokens, self-hosting options, advanced security, and dedicated support available for organizations.

**Token Usage Examples**:
- Simple function: 50-100 tokens
- Medium-sized script: 300-500 tokens
