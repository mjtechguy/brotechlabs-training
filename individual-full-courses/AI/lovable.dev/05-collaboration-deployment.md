# Chapter 5: Collaboration & Deployment - Teams and Publishing

## Introduction

Building applications is often a team effort, and getting your app in front of users is the ultimate goal. Lovable.dev provides comprehensive collaboration features for teams of any size, along with one-click deployment to make your applications publicly accessible. In this chapter, we'll explore workspaces, role-based permissions, publishing workflows, and custom domain setup.

**Documentation**: [Collaboration Features](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/collaboration)

## Workspaces: Organizing Projects and Teams

### What is a Workspace?

A **workspace** is like an organization or team account that contains:
- Multiple projects
- Multiple collaborators
- Shared billing and credits
- Unified settings

**Think of it as**: Your company's Lovable account where all team members and projects live.

### Workspace vs. Personal

**Personal Account**:
- Individual user
- Personal projects
- Own billing

**Workspace**:
- Team environment
- Multiple members
- Shared resources
- Centralized management

### Creating and Managing Workspaces

**Create New Workspace**:
1. Click workspace dropdown
2. "+ New Workspace"
3. Name it (e.g., "Acme Inc" or "Design Team")
4. Choose plan (Free/Pro/Business)

**Multiple Workspaces**:
- You can create/join multiple workspaces
- Switch between them easily
- Each has separate projects and billing

**Use Cases**:
- **Company Workspace**: Main business projects
- **Client Workspace**: Projects for specific client
- **Personal Workspace**: Side projects
- **Open Source Workspace**: Community projects

## Collaboration Features

#### **Editor**

**Can**:
- Everything Viewers can do
- Use AI to edit project (Agent/Chat modes)
- Make visual edits
- Edit code in Code Mode
- Publish updates

**Cannot**:
- Invite/remove members
- Delete project
- Manage billing
- Transfer ownership

**Use For**:

**Note**: Every workspace/project has exactly one Owner

### Permissions Matrix

| Action | Viewer | Editor | Admin | Owner |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| View project | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| View code | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Edit with AI | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Visual edits | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

## Real-Time Collaboration

### Concurrent Editing

**Multiple people can work simultaneously**:
- See changes as they happen
- Real-time preview updates
- Collaborative development

**How It Works**:
```
Developer A: "Add user authentication"
Developer B: Sees AI implementing auth in real-time

Developer B: "Add profile page"
Developer A: Sees profile page appear immediately
```

**Combined with GitHub**:
- Changes sync to GitHub automatically
- Full commit history preserved
- Can review diffs and merges

### Credit Sharing

**Important**: When collaborators use AI, they consume **workspace owner's credits**.

**How It Works**:
- Team members don't need their own paid plan
- All AI usage draws from workspace credit pool
- Workspace owner sees combined usage

**Example**:
```
Your Pro plan: 200 credits/month

Team usage:
- You: 50 credits
- Designer: 30 credits
- Developer: 40 credits
Total: 120 credits used of 200
```

**Best Practice**: Higher tiers for active teams
- Pro 200 or 400 for small teams
- Business plans for larger organizations

## Project Visibility

### Public Projects

**Characteristics**:
- Visible in community gallery

## Publishing Your Application

### One-Click Publish

**Documentation**: [Publishing Guide](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/publish)

**How It Works**:

**Steps**:
1. Click "Publish" button in project
2. Lovable performs security scan
3. Review any findings
4. Confirm publication
5. App goes live immediately

**What You Get**:
- Live URL: `yourproject.lovable.app`
- HTTPS/SSL automatically
- Global CDN delivery

**AI Auto-Fix**:
```
Finding: "API key exposed in frontend code"

Options:
[Try to Fix] - AI attempts to move key to Secrets vault
[Fix Manually] - You handle it
[Ignore] - Publish anyway (not recommended)
```

**Example Output**:
```
Security Scan Results:

üî¥ ERRORS (3)
- API key exposed in HomePage.tsx line 42
- Database rule allows public write access
- Password stored in plain text

üü° WARNINGS (2)

**4. Publish**:
- Confirm publication
- App goes live
- URL becomes accessible

**5. Monitor**:
- Check analytics
- Monitor logs
- Gather user feedback

### Unpublishing

**Need to take app offline?**

**Steps**:
1. Project settings
2. Click "Unpublish"
3. Confirm

**Result**:
- URL shows "Project not found"
- Code remains in workspace
- Can republish anytime

**Use Cases**:
- Emergency maintenance
- Major bugs discovered
- Temporary suspension

## Custom Domains

### Overview

Instead of `yourproject.lovable.app`, use your own domain like `www.yoursite.com`.

**Requirements**: Pro or Business plan

**Documentation**: [Custom Domain Setup](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/custom-domain)

### Setting Up Custom Domain

**High-Level Process**:
1. Purchase domain (Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.)
2. Add domain in Lovable
3. Configure DNS records
4. Verify connection
5. SSL certificate issued automatically

### Step-by-Step

**In Lovable**:
1. Project settings
2. "Custom Domain" tab
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `app.mycompany.com`)
4. Lovable provides DNS instructions

**DNS Configuration**:

**Option A: Subdomain** (`app.mycompany.com`):
```
Type: CNAME
Name: app
Value: yourproject.lovable.app
```

**Option B: Root Domain** (`mycompany.com`):
```
Type: A Record
Name: @
Value: [IP address provided by Lovable]
```

**At Your DNS Provider**:
1. Log into domain registrar
2. Find DNS management
3. Add records as instructed
4. Save changes

**Back in Lovable**:
1. Click "Verify"
2. Lovable checks DNS propagation
3. Issues SSL certificate (automatic)
4. Domain becomes active

**Timeline**:
- DNS propagation: 5 minutes to 48 hours (usually <1 hour)
- SSL certificate: Automatic once DNS verified

### Entri Integration

**Simplified DNS Setup**:

Lovable partners with **Entri** to automate DNS configuration:

**If Your Provider Supports Entri**:
1. Click "Auto-Configure DNS"
2. Authorize Entri to access your domain
3. DNS records added automatically
4. Verification happens instantly

**Benefits**:
- No manual DNS editing
- Faster setup
- Fewer errors

**Supported Registrars**: Check Entri documentation

### Multiple Domains

You can connect multiple domains to one project:
- `www.mysite.com` (primary)
- `mysite.com` (root, redirects to www)
- `app.mysite.com` (alternative)

### SSL/HTTPS

**Automatic SSL Certificates**:
- Free SSL via Let's Encrypt
- Auto-renewal every 90 days
- HTTPS enforced
- No manual configuration

**Result**: üîí Secure connection for all users

## Team Workflows

### Recommended Workflow for Teams

#### Small Teams (2-5 people)

**Approach: Direct Collaboration**

1. **Everyone edits in Lovable**
   - Real-time collaboration
   - See changes immediately
   - AI-assisted development

2. **GitHub for backup**
   - Automatic sync enabled
   - Version history preserved

3. **Publish from Lovable**
   - Security scan
   - One team member publishes

**Benefits**:
- Fast iteration
- Minimal process overhead
- Great for startups and prototypes

#### Medium Teams (5-20 people)

**Approach: Branch-Based**

1. **Lovable development branch**
   - All Lovable edits go to `dev` branch
   - Continuous GitHub sync

2. **Review in GitHub**
   - Create pull requests from `dev` to `main`
   - Code review process
   - Run tests (CI/CD)

3. **Deploy `main` branch**
   - Merge approved PRs
   - `main` deploys to production
   - Lovable or external hosting (Netlify/Vercel)

**Benefits**:
- Code review process
- Quality control
- Separation of dev/production

#### Large Teams (20+ people)

**Approach: Hybrid Development**

1. **Lovable for rapid prototyping**
   - Product managers and designers build prototypes
   - Validate ideas quickly

2. **Developers refine externally**
   - Clone from GitHub
   - Work in traditional IDEs
   - Add complex logic
   - Maintain code quality standards

3. **CI/CD pipeline**
   - Automated testing
   - Staging environments
   - Production deployment

**Benefits**:
- Best of both worlds
- Leverage Lovable for speed
- Maintain engineering standards

### Example Team Roles

**Scenario: Building a SaaS Product**

- Team code review
- External deployment options

**When**:
- Set up GitHub integration at project creation
- Don't wait until later

### 4. Review Security Scans

**Don't Ignore Warnings**:
- AI can miss edge cases
- Manual review important
- Fix critical issues before publish

### 5. Test Before Publishing

**Checklist**:
- ‚úÖ All features work in preview
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsive
- ‚úÖ Forms validate properly
- ‚úÖ Database connections secure
- ‚úÖ No exposed secrets
- ‚úÖ Error handling implemented

### 6. Monitor After Launch
