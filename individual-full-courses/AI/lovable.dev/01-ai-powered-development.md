# Chapter 1: AI-Powered Development - Chat with AI to Build Apps

## Introduction

Imagine describing what you want to build in plain English—"Create a todo app with user authentication and a modern dark mode interface"—and having a complete, working application appear in minutes. This is the core capability of Lovable.dev. But it goes beyond simple code generation: Lovable offers **two AI interaction modes** that work together to give you both autonomous development power and guided learning. In this chapter, we'll explore how to effectively use AI to build applications through conversation.

**Learn More**: [AI Development Modes Documentation](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/modes)

## What is AI-Powered Development with Lovable?

**AI-powered development** in Lovable means creating full-stack web applications by having natural language conversations with AI, rather than writing code manually. The AI doesn't just generate snippets—it builds complete features, handles backend infrastructure, debugs issues, and even searches the web for documentation when needed.

**Key Difference**: Unlike AI coding assistants that help you write code, Lovable's AI can autonomously plan, execute, and deploy entire applications.

## The Two AI Modes: Agent vs. Chat

Lovable offers two distinct ways to interact with AI, each serving different purposes:

### Agent Mode: Your Autonomous Developer

**What it is**: Agent Mode is where the AI works **autonomously** to handle complex,

 multi-step tasks end-to-end.

**How it works**:
- You describe a feature or fix (e.g., "Add user authentication")
- The AI **plans all required steps** on its own
- It **executes changes** without further input from you
- Can modify codebase, refactor code, debug errors
- Inspects logs to diagnose issues
- Searches the web for documentation and assets
- Can generate and edit images as needed

**Example Flow**:
```
You: "Add user authentication with email and password"

Agent Mode:
1. Creates signup/login pages automatically
2. Sets up user database table in Lovable Cloud
3. Configures Supabase authentication
4. Implements password security (hashing, validation)
5. Sets up row-level security policies
6. Adds logout functionality
7. Tests the flow and fixes any errors

Result: Complete auth system without you specifying each step
```

**When to Use Agent Mode**:
- ✅ Building complete features
- ✅ Large refactoring tasks
- ✅ Debugging complex issues
- ✅ When you want to describe the outcome, not the steps
- ✅ Production-quality code needed

**Pricing Note**: Agent Mode uses **usage-based credits**:
- Simple requests: <1 credit
- Complex features: 1-3 credits
- The more complex the task, the more credits consumed

**Key Capabilities**:
- **Read and modify codebase**: Full access to your project files
- **Refactor code**: Improve structure and organization
- **Debug errors**: Inspect logs and fix issues
- **Search the web**: Find documentation and code examples
- **Generate/edit images**: Create visual assets
- **Real-time debugging**: Monitor application behavior
- **Fetch external resources**: Get images, libraries, examples

### Chat Mode: Your Pair Programming Partner

**What it is**: Chat Mode is a conversational assistant for **planning and problem-solving** without directly modifying code.

**How it works**:
- Ask questions, get explanations
- Request debugging help
- Plan out features before implementing
- Learn how things work
- **AI provides read-only analysis**
- Does not modify code unless you confirm

**Example Flow**:
```
You: "Why isn't my form saving data to the database?"

Chat Mode:
1. Inspects your database schema
2. Checks relevant code files (read-only)
3. Analyzes error logs
4. Explains the issue: "Your form is missing the onSubmit handler"
5. Provides step-by-step fix plan
6. Shows "Implement the plan" button

You click "Implement" → switches to Agent Mode to execute the fix
```

**When to Use Chat Mode**:
- ✅ Learning and understanding code
- ✅ Brainstorming features
- ✅ Debugging before making changes
- ✅ Planning complex implementations
- ✅ Getting explanations
- ✅ Reviewing before modifying

**Pricing Note**: Every message in Chat Mode costs a **flat 1 credit**, regardless of complexity.

**Key Capabilities**:
- **Reasoning through problems**: Multi-step analysis
- **Read project context**: Understands your codebase
- **Analyze logs**: Diagnose errors without changing code
- **Explain concepts**: Teaching and documentation
- **Plan implementation**: Step-by-step roadmaps
- **"Implement the plan" button**: Seamlessly switch to Agent Mode

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Agent Mode | Chat Mode |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| **Modifies Code** | ✅ Yes, autonomously | ❌ No (read-only) |
| **Best For** | Building features | Planning and learning |
| **Pricing** | Usage-based (<1 to 3+ credits) | Flat 1 credit per message |
| **Autonomy** | Fully autonomous | Guided conversation |
| **Code Changes** | Immediate execution | Only after confirmation |
| **Use Case** | "Add authentication" | "How should I add authentication?" |
| **Output** | Working code | Explanation + plan |

## Supported AI Models

Lovable provides access to **multiple state-of-the-art AI models** without requiring separate API keys or accounts.

**No API Keys Required**: Lovable provides built-in access to all these models. You don't need separate OpenAI or Google accounts—it's all included in your subscription.

**Model Selection**: You can specify which model to use in your prompts:
```
"Use GPT-5 to analyze this data structure"
"Generate this component with Gemini Pro"
```

## The Development Workflow

### Step 1: Natural Language Prompts

Start by describing what you want to build in plain, specific language.

**Examples of Effective Prompts**:

**Good Prompt** ✅:
```
"Create a blog platform with:
- Homepage showing recent posts
- Individual post pages with comments
- Author profiles
- Dark mode toggle
- Responsive design for mobile"
```

**Vague Prompt** ❌:
```
"Make a blog"
```

**Good Prompt** ✅:
```
"Build a weather dashboard that:
- Lets users search cities
- Shows current temperature, conditions, humidity
- Displays 5-day forecast
- Uses OpenWeather API
- Has location auto-detect"
```

**Vague Prompt** ❌:
```
"I need a weather thing"
```

### Step 2: AI Processing & Generation

When you submit a prompt, here's what happens:

1. **Understanding**: AI analyzes your requirements
2. **Planning**: Decides on architecture and components
3. **Generation**: Writes HTML/CSS/JavaScript/TypeScript
4. **Framework Selection**: Chooses appropriate tools (React, Next.js, etc.)
5. **Integration**: Ensures components work together
6. **Backend Setup** (if Lovable Cloud enabled): Creates database schema, auth, etc.

**This happens in seconds to minutes**, depending on complexity.

### Step 3: Real-Time Preview

You immediately see your application running in the preview window:
- Click buttons, fill forms, test functionality
- See exactly how it looks and works
- Identify what needs adjustment
- Iterate without waiting for deployment

### Step 4: Iterative Refinement

Continue the conversation to improve:

```
"Make the header sticky when scrolling"
"Change color scheme to navy and gold"
"Add a loading spinner while data loads"
"Add user profile pictures to comments"
```

**The AI remembers context**, so it knows you're referring to the current project.

## Visual Editor: Click-to-Modify

For quick design tweaks, Lovable includes a **Visual Edits** mode.

**Documentation**: [Visual Editor Guide](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/visual-edit)

### How It Works

1. **Enable Visual Edits mode** in the interface
2. **Hover over elements** in the preview
3. **Click to select** (elements highlight)
4. **Edit directly**: Change text, colors, fonts
5. **Drag to resize** elements

### What You Can Change

- ✅ Text content
- ✅ Colors (text, background)
- ✅ Fonts (family, size, weight)
- ✅ Element sizing (width, height, padding)
- ✅ Basic layout adjustments

### Credit Usage

- **Simple edits**: No credits consumed
- **AI-assisted edits**: Using prompts while an element is selected costs credits

**Example**:
```
1. Click a heading
2. Type "Our Amazing Products" to change text → Free
3. Or: Select heading and prompt "Make this bold and dark green" → Uses credits
```

### Limitations

- ❌ Only works on **static content**
- ❌ Cannot select **dynamic elements** (e.g., list items from database)
- ❌ For dynamic content, use Agent Mode instead

## Code Mode: Direct Editing

For users who want full control, **Code Mode** (Pro/Business plans) provides a built-in code editor.

**Documentation**: [Code Mode Guide](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/code-mode)

### What You Get

- **Full source code access**: View all HTML/JSX, CSS, TypeScript
- **Syntax highlighting**: Readable, color-coded code
- **Direct editing**: Modify code manually
- **Real-time sync**: Changes reflect immediately
- **Standard formats**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

### When to Use Code Mode

- ✅ Review AI-generated code
- ✅ Make precise technical changes
- ✅ Learn from generated code
- ✅ Fine-tune performance
- ✅ Add complex logic AI doesn't understand

**Philosophy**: Lovable isn't a black box. You can always see and modify the code it creates.

## Custom Knowledge Base

Every project has a **Custom Knowledge** section where you provide AI with project-specific context.

**Documentation**: [Custom Knowledge Guide](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/knowledge)

### What to Include

**Brand Guidelines**:
```
"Our brand color is #003366 (navy blue)"
"Use 'customer' not 'client' throughout"
"All buttons should have rounded corners"
```

**Technical Requirements**:
```
"Follow REST API conventions for all endpoints"
"Use TypeScript strict mode"
"Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance"
```

**Project Goals**:
```
"Target audience: Small business owners"
"Priority: Mobile-first design"
"Important: Page load under 2 seconds"
```

### Why It Matters

- **Consistency**: AI remembers your preferences across all prompts
- **Fewer Corrections**: Reduces back-and-forth
- **Team Alignment**: All collaborators work with same context
- **Quality**: Better matches your vision from the start

### Best Practices

- Keep it concise (bullet points work well)
- Update as project evolves
- Include coding conventions, design preferences, key APIs

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

**Documentation**: [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://docs.lovable.dev/guides/prompt-engineering)

### 1. Be Specific and Descriptive

**Weak** ❌: "Make it look better"
**Strong** ✅: "Increase heading font size to 36px, add 40px spacing between sections, use a subtle shadow on cards"

### 2. Break Complex Tasks into Steps

Instead of:
```
"Build a complete e-commerce platform"
```

Try:
```
Step 1: "Create product listing page with grid layout"
Step 2: "Add product detail page with image gallery"
Step 3: "Implement shopping cart functionality"
Step 4: "Add Stripe checkout integration"
```

### 3. Provide Context and Examples

```
"Add a testimonials section similar to how Airbnb displays reviews:
- Customer photo on the left
- Quote text
- Name and location below
- 5-star rating display"
```

### 4. Specify Technical Details When Needed

```
"Create a data table that:
- Fetches from /api/users endpoint
- Shows name, email, role columns
- Has search and filter by role
- Pagination (10 per page)
- Sortable columns"
```

### 5. Iterate Incrementally

Build in layers:
1. Basic structure
2. Styling
3. Functionality
4. Edge cases
5. Polish

### 6. Use the Undo Feature

If the AI makes an unwanted change:
- Use the "Undo" button
- Clarify what you actually wanted
- Try rephrasing your prompt

## Common Patterns and Examples

### Example 1: Landing Page

**Prompt**:
```
"Create a landing page for a fitness app with:

Header:
- Logo on left, navigation on right

   - Total revenue card
   - Sales chart (line graph by date)
   - Top products table
   - Regional breakdown (pie chart)
   - Date range filter

4. Style: Clean, professional, use charts library"
```

**Result**: Full-stack dashboard with database and visualizations in ~2-3 minutes

### Example 3: User Authentication

**Prompt**:
```
"Add user authentication:
- Email/password signup
- Login page
- Password requirements (8+ chars, number, special char)
- Protected routes (redirect to login if not authenticated)
- User profile page showing email
- Logout button"
```

**Result**: Complete auth system with database in ~90 seconds
