# Week 3: Infrastructure Automation

Learn to automate your infrastructure deployments using cloud-init and bash scripts.

---

## Overview

In Week 2, you manually set up everything step-by-step. In Week 3, you'll automate those same steps so scripts do the work for you.

**Time savings:** Deploy infrastructure in 20 minutes instead of 2-3 hours!

---

## What You'll Learn

- Cloud-init basics (automatic server setup)
- Bash scripting fundamentals
- Automating Docker deployments
- Infrastructure as Code concepts

---
