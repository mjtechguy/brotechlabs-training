- Potential data leakage from models
- Surveillance capabilities
- Mitigation: Differential privacy, on-device processing, regulation

**Safety and Reliability:**
- "Hallucinations" (confident but wrong outputs)
- Adversarial attacks
- Unexpected behaviors
- Mitigation: Testing, human-in-the-loop, confidence scoring

**Misinformation and Deepfakes:**
- Synthetic media indistinguishable from real
- Political manipulation
- Fraud and impersonation
- Mitigation: Watermarking, detection tools, media literacy

### EU AI Act (2025 Implementation)

**Status:** World's first comprehensive AI law

**Key Dates:**
- February 2, 2025: Ban on unacceptable-risk AI

- August 1, 2026: Full implementation

**Risk-Based Approach:**

**Unacceptable Risk (BANNED):**
- Social scoring (like China)
- Real-time biometric surveillance (with exceptions)
- Manipulative AI exploiting vulnerabilities

**High-Risk (Strict Requirements):**
- Critical infrastructure
- Education and hiring
- Law enforcement
- Requirements: Testing, documentation, human oversight, transparency

**General-Purpose AI (GPT, Gemini, etc.):**
- Technical documentation
- Copyright disclosure
- Systemic risk assessment
- Code of practice compliance

**Limited Risk (Transparency):**
- Chatbots must be labeled as AI
- Deepfakes must be disclosed
- Emotion recognition must notify users

**Enforcement:**
- Fines up to €35M or 7% global revenue
- National agencies
- Conformity assessments

### US Approach

**Federal Level:**
- Executive orders (policy, not law)
- Sector-specific regulation (FTC, EEOC, FDA)
- No comprehensive AI law yet

**State Level:**
- California: CCPA applies to AI, deepfake laws
- Colorado: AI discrimination law
- Patchwork creating complexity

**Trajectory:**
- Eventual federal law likely
- Currently slower than EU

### China's Approach

**Characteristics:**
