## Getting Started Checklist

Ready to start using AI tools? Here's a suggested path:

- [ ] Create account with one conversational AI (ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini)
- [ ] Try asking it 5 different types of questions
- [ ] If you code or want to learn: try GitHub Copilot or Cursor

## Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Being too vague**: "Write something" vs "Write a professional email thanking a client for their business"

2. **Not iterating**: If the first response isn't perfect, ask for changes rather than giving up

3. **Expecting perfection**: AI is a tool, not magic. It makes mistakes.

4. **Using only one tool**: Different tools excel at different things

5. **Not exploring features**: Most tools have features beyond the basics - explore!
