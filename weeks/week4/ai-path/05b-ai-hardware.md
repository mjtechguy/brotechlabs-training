# AI Hardware: The Chips That Power Intelligence

You've learned about AI models and how they work, but what actually runs these models? Just like a sports car needs a powerful engine, AI needs specialized hardware to perform billions of calculations per second. Let's explore the chips and processors that make AI possible.

## Why Specialized AI Hardware Matters

**Regular computer processors** (CPUs - Central Processing Units) are like a Swiss Army knife - good at many different tasks. But AI requires doing the same type of calculation billions of times simultaneously, which is where specialized chips excel.

**Simple analogy**: Imagine you need to paint a huge warehouse:
- **CPU**: One person with a paintbrush (versatile, but slow for big jobs)
- **GPU**: 100 people with paint rollers working in parallel (much faster for repetitive tasks)
- **TPU/AI chips**: 1,000 people with paint sprayers designed specifically for warehouses (fastest, purpose-built)

## Types of AI Hardware

### 1. GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)

**What it is**: Originally designed for rendering graphics in video games, GPUs turned out to be perfect for AI calculations.

**How it works**:
- Contains thousands of small processors working simultaneously
- Excels at parallel processing (doing many calculations at once)
- Each processor isn't very smart, but together they're incredibly powerful

**Why AI uses them**:
- AI training and inference involve matrix multiplication (mathematical operations perfect for parallel processing)
- Can perform thousands of calculations simultaneously
- Much faster than CPUs for AI workloads (10-100x)

**Real-world use**:
- Training AI models
- Running AI locally on your computer
- Data centers powering cloud AI services
- Gaming (their original purpose!)
