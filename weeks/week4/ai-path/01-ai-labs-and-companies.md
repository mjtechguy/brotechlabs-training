# AI Labs and Companies: Who's Building the Future?

Understanding the major players in AI helps you know where the technology is coming from and which tools you might want to use. Think of these companies as different car manufacturers - they all make cars (AI), but each has different strengths and approaches.

## Major AI Labs and Companies

### OpenAI

**What they do**: OpenAI is one of the most well-known AI (Artificial Intelligence) companies, best known for creating ChatGPT.

**Key Products** (as of October 2025):
- **ChatGPT**: A conversational AI that can answer questions, write content, help with code, and more - now powered by GPT-5
- **GPT-5**: Released August 2025, their most advanced language model with ~45% fewer errors than GPT-4 and enhanced reasoning capabilities
- **GPT-5 Pro**: Enterprise-focused model for finance, legal, and healthcare (announced October 2025)
- **GPT-5-Codex**: Specialized version for complex software engineering tasks
- **DALL-E 3**: AI that creates images from text descriptions
- **Sora 2**: Revolutionary video generation AI (released September 2025) that creates realistic videos with synchronized sound and dialogue from text prompts
- **o4-mini**: Fast, cost-efficient reasoning model

**Why they matter**: OpenAI made AI accessible to everyday people. Before ChatGPT launched in late 2022, most AI tools were only for researchers or developers. Their continuous innovations (GPT-5, Sora 2) keep pushing the boundaries of what AI can do.

**Think of them as**: The company that brought AI to the masses, like Apple did for smartphones.
